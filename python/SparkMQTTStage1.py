# This is implementation for Cloud + Edge = iotx Stage 1. Cloud is represented
# by Apache Spark and Edge computing framework is Calvin. Apache Spark is
# receiving temperature data from Calvin via MQTT (pub/sub model). This
# program calculates running average using windowing and sliding interval
# technique and sends the result back to Calvin via MQTT
#
# iotx stage 1 demo
